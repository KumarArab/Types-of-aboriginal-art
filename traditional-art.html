								<p>Artistic expression has historically and simultaneously evolved as a part of human civilizations around the world (Dutton, 2010). Many scholars assert that art making is an integral part of human functioning and would not have evolved or been a sustained part of human existence if it did not serve a significant adaptive purpose (Dutton, 2010; Davies, 2012; Kaimal, 2019). These scholars argue that art and art making have identified roles in evoking emotions, problem solving, imagination, memorializing life events, and enabling non-verbal communication (Dissanayake, 2000; Dutton, 2010; Winner, 2018). Dissanayake (2000) for example, identified art making as being integral to humans in establishing rituals and communication as well as, in “making special” key events and milestones in the lives of individuals in communities. There has, however, been limited examination of the therapeutic role of the arts in helping individuals cope in response to challenges including deriving strength from individual creative capacity and sense of community.</p>
								<p>In the present day, mental health issues are a worldwide challenge: The World Health Organization (2019) cautioned that lack of mental well-being is a leading cause of disease burden around the world, with one-fourth of the global population at risk of developing a mental health challenge in their lifetime and one-fifth of children and adolescents having mental health problems. Wars, adversity, discrimination, illness, and natural disasters further exacerbate these unmet needs of psychosocial support. Most parts of the world have very limited resources and few skilled professionals to support mental health and well-being. </p>
